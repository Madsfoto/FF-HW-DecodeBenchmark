**Unfinished**

Very early test to see what h264 profile + levels are supported by ffmpeg as hardware decoded. 

Taken from the code: 
for each mov/mp4 file in the current dir do
ffmpeg -i INPUT_FILE -benchmark -f null - > INPUT_FILE-SW.txt

List of hwaccels: -hwaccel auto, -hwaccel cuda, -hwaccel d3d11va, -hwaccel d3d12va, -hwaccel dxva2, -hwaccel nvdec, -hwaccel opencl, -hwaccel vulkan

Example of hwaccel use: 
ffmpeg -hwaccel auto -i INPUT_FILE -benchmark -f null - > INPUT_FILE-HW.txt

The program takes all the mov/mp4 files in the current directory and creates a .bat file with each line being a compare line.
Then it will ask to execute the bat (which may take a while)
Then it will create a 1Speed.txt with a CSV file of the input filename;hwaccel;wallClockTime from ffmpeg. 


This code requires ffmpeg.exe to be somewhere in PATH (or the current directory)
